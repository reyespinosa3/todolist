Welcome to the Puppy To Do List

This project uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JQuery to create a To Do List with
a puppy theme. The To Do List will allow you to enter a new item to the list,
remove an item from the list and mark an item as completed. Below is the
wireframe to show what the project should look like when completed.
